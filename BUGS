-   Fullscreen works via F11 (our own event) only, not using window manager
event. (At least not in awesome)

-   ``Scroll'' variable is a poor way of representing the current page count
etc. It should be representated as a certain percentage of a specific page, for
example. That would allow us to deal with scaling properly.

-   We don't properly handle PDFs with different page sizes.
    To fix this, we need to get the size of each page in a PDF. This can take
    some time. We can do this while showing the first page?

-   To perform text search we need to know the text of all the pages.
    Perhaps we can load this on start as well.
